        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Asparagus and eggs make the best spring breakfast or a beautiful light lunch. Asparagus is cooked in a pan with a little oil, and topped with two eggs.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>1 garlic clove, finely chopped</li>
            <li>8 thin-stemmed asparagus stalks, trimmed</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 pinch red pepper flakes (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><h4>Step 1</h4>
            <p>Heat a small skillet over medium-high heat. Add olive oil and garlic; cook and stir until garlic is fragrant, about 30 seconds.</p>
            </li>
            <li><h4>Step 2</h4>
            <p>Add asparagus and cook until fork-tender, turning asparagus often to ensure even cooking, about 4 minutes.</p>
            </li>
            <li><h4>Step 3</h4>
            <p>Spread asparagus out and crack 2 eggs over the asparagus. Cover with lid and cook until egg whites are firm and yolk is done to desired consistency, about 4 minutes.</p>
            </li>
            <li><h4>Step 4</h4>
            <p>Season with salt and pepper; sprinkle with red pepper flakes and serve immediately.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
